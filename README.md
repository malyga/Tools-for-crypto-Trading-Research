# Download and Process Trading Data from Binance

## Information about the scripts:

* The `download_binance_data.py` script is a working version that allows to download the trading data (OHLC, Volume, Trades, etc.) from `Binance` via `Binance API`.
The script downloads the data per a symbol and stores it within a directory as .csv files.

* The `process_binance_data.py` script is created to generate OHLC, Volume tables separately. Each table contains one type of data (e.g., close prices) for several tickers. This format is handy while designing trading strategies. It is assumed that the input data for this script is downloaded from `Binance` via `Binance API` using `download_binance_data.py`. The tool is useful to process massive data sets with time-series of frequent data (seconds, minutes, etc.). The scrips are limited in terms of documentation and comments.
